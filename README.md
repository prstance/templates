# Templates Repository

Welcome to the "templates" repository. This repository has been created to gather and organize various templates that I use in my projects. Whether it's code templates, documentation templates, or other reusable resources, you'll find them here.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to existing templates are also welcome! If you want to make improvements or modifications to the existing templates, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the project.
2. Make changes or improvements to the existing templates.
3. Create a **pull request** with a brief description of your changes.

If you have new templates to share, you can still follow the previous contribution steps mentioned for adding entirely new templates.

## License

All templates in this repository are licensed under [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). Make sure to comply with the license terms before using or redistributing the templates.

## Notes

Feel free to open an **issue** if you have suggestions, questions, or if you've encountered any issues.

I hope this repository proves helpful in your projects!
